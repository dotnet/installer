      SourceBuiltVersionNumber is the version of a tar.gz that can be used to get 
      a tar.gz of .NET build outputs from a previous build needed to build the current version of .NET,
      a tar.gz of assets downloaded from the internet that are needed to build the current version of .NET, or
      a tar.gz of the source build .NET SDK from the previous release for a particular OS.
