      Building .NET from source depends on one or two tar.gz files depending on the branch's current
      source-buildability status.

      PrivateSourceBuiltArtifactsPackageVersion is a tar.gz of .NET build outputs from a previous
      build needed to build the current version of .NET. This is always defined, because .NET needs
      to be bootstrappable at any point in time.

      PrivateSourceBuiltPrebuiltsPackageVersion is a tar.gz of assets downloaded from the internet
      that are needed to build the current version of .NET. Early in the lifecycle of a .NET major
      or minor release, prebuilts may be needed. When the release is mature, prebuilts are not
      necessary, and this property is removed from the file.
