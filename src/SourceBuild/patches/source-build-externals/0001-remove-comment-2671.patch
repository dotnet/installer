Subject: [PATCH] remove comment (#2671)

Backport: https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/pull/2671

The patch in question removes a licensing declaration that is incompatable with the VMR.
If the patch would be applied in source-build-externals directly, the change would be made onto
the inner source-build (i.e. the package produced), while the VMR entry for it would still be
affected.

This can be removed once a new release version of the package is available and used by the .NET repos:
